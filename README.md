Trash.ly: Recycle It Properly!

# #AndroidDevChallenge

## Android Dev Challenge Submission Idea Description

Being an environment aware consumer I pay attention to what is accepted in recycle in my area. Still, I am always wondering whether I should put a Starbucks cup to the "trash" or "recycle" bin. Things exacerbate when I move around: just cross a bridge, and rules in Fairfax County are not the same as in Montgomery County, and I am not even talking about interstate differences. It will come to you as a surprise, but "25% of items placed in recycling bins are non-recyclable", a study says. How cool it would be to take a picture of no longer needed items and learn (1) current recycle rules in a given geo-area and (2) what are eco-friendly offers from major brands are (like, collection of nespresso cups, brita filters, etc.), if any.
